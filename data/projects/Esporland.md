[Work In Progress]

To create a good reader experience, worked alongside a team of designers and journalists, providing feedback regarding development aspects.

To provide good SEO, performance scores and writer experience, researched various technologies and measured their trade-offs by involving in conversations with the team. Decided on a tech stack with an open-vote approach.

Development effort is ongoing using Next.js and Wordpress as headless CMS.

Led a small team of mid-level and junior engineers, reviewed pull requests, labelled issues and involved in conversations regarding feature requests, bugs, etc.
