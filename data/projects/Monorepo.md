A repository containing projects linked to Kamp.us community. The repository is a monorepo, which means that it contains multiple projects. The projects are built using Remix, React, Prisma, Node, GraphQL, TypeScript and JavaScript.
Proposed a notification service for one of the applications (Pano), and worked on creating the service from designing the flow to implementing it. The service received positive reviews from both end users and stakeholders.

Started leading the Kampus job board project, which enables people from the community to post jobs and search for a job seemingly.

The application needed OAuth flows, integrated with the existing user authentication system, worked on creating GitHub and Discord OAuth flows, and integrated social profiles of users with existing user accounts on the Kampus-Pano app.

Created visual components for the Kampus-UI component library package which later been used in various places in Kampus apps.

Helped solve various bugs and closed various issues by getting involved in conversations and opening up pull requests regarding the issues.
