Acted as a maintainer while transforming the heatmap to gather and visualize ballot box observer information before the election and ballot box record information after the election for election fairness. Solved various issues and reviewed various pull requests from a team of highly skilled engineers.

Worked alongside various teams for design, backend and chatbots, ensuring smooth communication while bringing up new features to production.

The application served its purpose to make sure fewer ballot boxes remain unobserved before and during the election, and more ballot box records get collected by unbiased authorities afterwards. The site got removed after the Turkish elections concluded.
