A solo project that is meant to be played by children in the University of St Andrews’ outreach events. Includes a simple web-based accessible interface, drag-and-drop code generation blocks and simple puzzles that are meant to be solved approximately in an hour.

During development, found some examples using legacy approaches and bugs inside Google’s drag-and-drop code generation library (Blockly), and opened up issues and pull requests which solve the bugs and updates the examples to use modern approaches. Which later got merged into the development branch.

The application contains functionalities like level selection and theming.
